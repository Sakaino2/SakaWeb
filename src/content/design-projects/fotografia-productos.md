## Project Overview

This project was a personal challenge to build a robust task management system from scratch. I focused on creating a clean, intuitive user interface and a secure, scalable backend API.

### Features

- User authentication and authorization.
- CRUD operations for tasks (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Real-time updates using WebSockets.

### Design Process

I started by sketching wireframes and creating mockups in Figma to ensure a smooth user experience before writing any code.

### Development Insights

I faced a challenge when implementing real-time updates for multiple users. I solved this by using a WebSocket library to handle communication between the client and server efficiently.
